# debiasedmcmc

This package contains scripts to reproduce the results of the arXiv report "Unbiased Markov chain Monte Carlo with couplings", by Pierre E. Jacob, John O'Leary and Yves F Atchade.

The Polya-Gamma sampler is taken from the package BayesLogit of Nick Polson, James Scott, and Jesse Windle.
https://cran.r-project.org/package=BayesLogit

The folder inst/reproduce/ contains README.R which explains how to run the scripts.
The folder inst/check/ contains internal checks, and inst/tutorials/ contains tutorials on
how to use the package's main functions.
